# üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

## Overview

The Autonomous PR System is a **cognitive agent system** that mimics the structure and decision-making of a real product organization. Built on LangGraph, it creates a self-improving engineering capability that understands not just HOW to build, but WHY and WHAT to build.

## Core Principles

### 1. Cognitive Organization Model
We model three essential loops that mirror human product development:

- **Demand Loop** - Identifies what matters (Product Management)
- **Production Loop** - Builds solutions (Engineering)  
- **Learning Loop** - Improves over time (Analytics)

### 2. Safety-First Design
Every action passes through multiple safety gates:
- Pattern matching for dangerous operations
- Complexity limits
- Human-in-the-loop approval
- Automated rollback capabilities

### 3. Observable & Traceable
Using LangGraph's state management:
- Every decision is logged
- State transitions are checkpointed
- Full audit trail for compliance

## Architecture Components

| Component | Purpose | Documentation |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Cognitive Loops | Core agent orchestration | [cognitive-loops.md](cognitive-loops.md) |
| State Management | LangGraph state design | [state-management.md](state-management.md) |
| Safety System | Multi-layer protection | [safety-design.md](safety-design.md) |
| Agent Framework | Base agent patterns | [agent-framework.md](agent-framework.md) |

## Technology Stack

- **Orchestration**: LangGraph 0.2.0
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4
- **State Storage**: PostgreSQL (checkpointing)
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Monitoring**: LangSmith
- **Integrations**: Linear, GitHub, Vercel, Sentry

## Design Decisions

### Why LangGraph?
1. **Stateful workflows** - Perfect for multi-agent systems
2. **Built-in checkpointing** - Crash recovery and debugging
3. **Human-in-the-loop** - Native approval gates
4. **Cyclic graphs** - Natural fit for feedback loops

### Why Cognitive Loops?
1. **Mirrors real organizations** - Familiar mental model
2. **Separation of concerns** - Each loop has clear purpose
3. **Natural feedback** - Learning improves all loops
4. **Scalable** - Add agents without changing structure

## Next Steps

1. Understand the [Cognitive Loops](cognitive-loops.md)
2. Review [State Management](state-management.md) design
3. Study [Safety Design](safety-design.md) principles
4. Explore the [Agent Framework](agent-framework.md)
