# Autonomous PR System - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We are building an **autonomous agent system** that mimics the cognitive and operational structure of a **real-world product organization**. This self-improving engineering org in a box:

- **Knows WHY it builds** (Demand Loop: Prospect → User → Buyer → Advocate)
- **Knows WHAT to build** (Validated needs from Linear backlog)
- **Knows HOW to build** (Production Loop: Creator → Editor → Reviewer → Merger)
- **Learns and improves** (Analyst feeds insights back to Prospect)

**Core Principle**: The system operates autonomously on `staging` but requires human approval for `main`.

### System Philosophy
Each agent represents a function of cognition:
- **Goal-seeking**: Prospect and User agents identify what matters
- **Evaluation**: Buyer and Reviewer agents assess worth and quality
- **Execution**: Creator and Builder agents implement solutions
- **Learning**: Analyst agent evolves understanding through feedback

### 🔒 Critical Safety Rules

#### Branch Protection
- **NEVER** push to: `main`, `master`, `staging`, `production`, `prod`
- **NEVER** merge pull requests to main or production
- **ONLY** work on feature branches (format: `auto/issue-id`)
- **ALWAYS** check branch name before any git operations

#### Code Safety
- **NEVER** delete production code without explicit confirmation
- **NEVER** modify critical infrastructure files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.)
- **NEVER** expose secrets, API keys, or credentials in code or logs
- **ALWAYS** validate inputs and handle edge cases defensively

#### User Issue Protection
- **NEVER** modify user-created issues without explicit permission
- **ALWAYS** identify AI-generated vs user-created issues
- **REQUIRE** clear AI markers on all agent-created issues
- **DEFAULT** to protection when issue origin is unclear

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Keep It Simple
- **Prefer** simple, readable solutions over clever abstractions
- **Avoid** over-engineering - the agent should be maintainable
- **Use** existing libraries rather than reimplementing functionality
- **Document** complex logic with clear comments

### Single Responsibility
- Each function should do ONE thing well
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into well-named helper functions

        Analyst --> |Updates priorities| Linear
    end
```

### Feedback-Fed Machine
The system creates a **closed cognitive loop** where:
1. **Demand defines value** through simulated human needs
2. **Production delivers value** through autonomous code generation
3. **Analysis refines understanding** through outcome observation
4. **Evolution improves selection** through feedback integration

      def validate_constraints(self) -> bool:
          # Safety checks before execution
          pass
  ```

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Backlog Execution Loop (Week 2-3)

### 1.1 BacklogReader Agent
**Purpose**: Intelligently select next task from Linear

**Linear Workflow Authority**:
- ✅ **CAN**: `Backlog` → `Backlog` (estimate & refine)
- ✅ **CAN**: `Backlog` → `Awaiting Approval` (quality gates pass)
- ✅ **CAN**: `Ready for Dev` → `Backlog` (quality gates fail)
- ❌ **CANNOT**: `Backlog` → `Ready for Dev` (human prioritization only)
- ❌ **CANNOT**: `Awaiting Approval` → Assignment (human approval only)

**Quality Gate Requirements**:
- 🔢 **Fibonacci Estimate** (1,2,3,5,8,13,21) - MANDATORY
- 📋 **Acceptance Criteria** - Structured, testable conditions
- 📝 **Clear Technical Details** - Implementation context
- 🎯 **Unambiguous Requirements** - High developer confidence

**Implementation**:
```python
class BacklogReaderAgent(BaseAgent):
    def select_next_task(self):
        # Priority algorithm:
        # 1. Critical bugs (P0)
        # 2. User-reported issues with high impact
        # 3. Small, well-defined features
        # 4. Tech debt with clear ROI
        
        # Filters:
        # - Must have clear acceptance criteria
        # - Must have Fibonacci estimate
        # - Estimated < 8 story points
        # - No external dependencies
        # - Not blocked by other issues
        # - In "Ready for Dev" state only
```

**Safety Rules**:
- Skip tasks requiring database migrations
- Skip tasks modifying authentication/authorization
- Skip tasks touching payment systems
- Require explicit "auto-pr-safe" label
- Never modify user-created issues

### 1.2 Creator Agent
**Purpose**: Initial code generation - the creative spark
**Cognitive Function**: Synthesis and creation

**Implementation**:
```python
class CreatorAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Writes the initial PR - focuses on solving the problem"""
    
    async def create_initial_solution(self, task: LinearTask):
        # Creative process: problem → solution
        solution_approach = await self.ideate_solution(task)
        
        # Generate initial implementation
        code = await self.generate_code(solution_approach)
        
        # Don't over-optimize - that's Editor's job
        return self.create_draft_pr(code)
```

### 1.3 Editor Agent

        # Add comprehensive tests
        tests = await self.generate_tests(draft_pr)
        
        # Improve code quality
        refined_code = await self.enhance_code_quality(draft_pr)
        
        # Ensure documentation
        docs = await self.update_documentation(draft_pr)
        
        return self.create_polished_pr(refined_code, tests, docs)
```

### 1.4 Reviewer Agent (Mercer)
**Purpose**: Quality gate and approval
**Cognitive Function**: Evaluation and validation

**Review Framework**:
- Code quality and conventions

## 🧠 Phase 2: Demand Loop - Cognitive Intent Formation (Week 4-5)

### 2.1 Prospect Agent - "Why do I care?"
**Cognitive Function**: Goal-seeking and need identification
**Purpose**: Discovers what truly matters to the system

**Implementation**:
```python
class ProspectAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Identifies core needs and pains - the 'why' behind building"""
    
    async def identify_needs(self):
        # Sources of "pain" or opportunity
        pain_signals = await self.gather_pain_signals()
        
        # Cognitive evaluation: What matters most?
        prioritized_needs = self.evaluate_importance(pain_signals)
        
        # Output: Clear problem statements
        return self.formulate_problems(prioritized_needs)
```

**Outputs**: Problem statements with clear "why" → Linear backlog

### 2.2 User Agent - "How do I try it?"
**Cognitive Function**: Exploration and experimentation
**Purpose**: Simulates trying to solve the identified problem

**Implementation**:
```python
class UserAgent(BaseAgent):
    """Simulates usage patterns and reveals friction"""
    
    async def explore_solution_space(self, problem):
        # Try different approaches
        attempts = await self.simulate_user_attempts(problem)
        
        # Identify friction points
        friction_points = self.analyze_difficulties(attempts)
        
        # Cognitive insight: What would make this easier?
        return self.suggest_improvements(friction_points)
```

### 2.3 Buyer Agent - "Is it worth it?"
**Cognitive Function**: Evaluation and decision-making
**Purpose**: Cost/benefit analysis of proposed solutions

**Decision Framework**:
- Effort required vs. impact delivered
- Risk assessment

        self.demand_loop = DemandLoop()
        self.production_loop = ProductionLoop()
        self.memory = LongTermMemory()
    
    async def run_cycle(self):
        # 1. Demand Loop generates intent
        need = await self.demand_loop.identify_next_need()
        
        # 2. Production Loop executes
        result = await self.production_loop.build_solution(need)
        
        # 3. Analyst observes outcomes
        insights = await self.analyze_results(result)
        
        # 4. System evolves
        await self.evolve_understanding(insights)
        
    async def evolve_understanding(self, insights):
        """The key to self-improvement"""
        # Update Prospect's understanding of what matters
        self.demand_loop.prospect.update_value_model(insights)
        
        # Improve Builder's code patterns

---

## 🧠 Philosophy: Engineering Org in a Box

### The Vision
This system represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software development. It's not just automation - it's a **self-aware, self-improving engineering organization** that:

1. **Understands Intent**: Through the Demand Loop, it knows WHY something should be built
2. **Executes Efficiently**: Through the Production Loop, it knows HOW to build well
3. **Learns Continuously**: Through the Analyst feedback, it gets better every cycle
4. **Operates Autonomously**: It makes decisions like a skilled team would

### Cognitive Architecture
```
PERCEPTION → REASONING → ACTION → LEARNING
     ↑                                 ↓
     ←←←←←←← EVOLUTION ←←←←←←←←←←←←←←←
```

Each agent is a **function of cognition**:
- **Prospect**: Pattern recognition and goal formation
- **User**: Experiential learning and empathy
- **Buyer**: Resource optimization and prioritization
- **Advocate**: Communication and influence
- **Creator**: Synthesis and innovation
- **Editor**: Refinement and quality
- **Reviewer**: Validation and risk assessment
- **Analyst**: Reflection and insight generation

### The Endgame
When fully realized, this system will:
- Generate more code than human developers
- Maintain higher quality standards
- Learn from every success and failure
- Evolve its own architecture
- Eventually contribute to its own development

This is the foundation for **AI-native software development** - where the organization itself is code, and improvement is continuous and autonomous.

**Remember**: We're not building a tool. We're building a colleague that never sleeps, always learns, and continuously improves. 🤖✨
