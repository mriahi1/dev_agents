# System Learning Protocol

## Overview

This directory captures learnings from each development iteration to enable continuous system improvement. Each session should result in actionable insights that prevent repeated mistakes and enhance future performance.

## Learning Categories

### 1. Process Learnings
- Workflow improvements
- Tool usage optimizations
- Communication patterns

### 2. Technical Learnings
- Code patterns to follow/avoid
- Architecture decisions
- Performance insights

### 3. Safety Learnings
- Security considerations
- Branch protection adherence
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. Quality Learnings
- Testing approaches
- Review processes
- Validation methods

## How to Document Learnings

After each significant task or session:

1. Create a new file: `YYYY-MM-DD-task-id.md`
2. Use the template below
3. Extract actionable rules
4. Update relevant documentation

## Learning Entry Template

```markdown
# Learning Entry: [Task ID] - [Brief Description]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Task**: [Linear Task ID or Description]
**Outcome**: [Success/Partial Success/Failure]

## What Happened
Brief narrative of the session

## What Went Well
- Bullet points of successes

## What Went Wrong
- Bullet points of issues

## Root Cause Analysis
Deep dive into why issues occurred

## Learnings
1. **Learning Title**: Specific, actionable learning
   - Context: When this applies
   - Action: What to do differently
   - Validation: How to verify improvement

## Action Items
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create new checks/validations
- [ ] Modify workflows
```

## Meta-Learning Process

Every 10 learning entries:
1. Review patterns across entries
2. Extract common themes
3. Update core documentation
4. Create automated checks where possible
