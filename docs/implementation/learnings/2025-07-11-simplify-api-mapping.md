# Simplifying API Parameter Mapping

## Date: 2025-07-11
## Task: KEY-252 (Code Review Feedback)

### What Happened
After implementing property â†’ operation conversion in the API service layer, received feedback that the comment "This will be converted to 'operation' by the API" was confusing and the approach seemed wrong.

### Initial Approach
```typescript
// In hook:
property: propertyId.toString(), // This will be converted to 'operation' by the API

// In API service:
if (params.property) {
  queryParams.append('operation', params.property); // Convert property to operation
}
```

### Problem
- Unclear where conversion happens ("by the API" is ambiguous)
- Added unnecessary abstraction layer
- Made debugging harder (have to trace through conversion)
- Created confusion about frontend vs backend terminology

### Better Approach
Use backend terminology directly in API-related code:
```typescript
// In hook:
operation: propertyId.toString(), // Backend API expects 'operation' for property filtering

// In API service:
if (params.operation) {
  queryParams.append('operation', params.operation); // Direct pass-through
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Clarity**: Clear what parameter the backend expects
2. **Simplicity**: No conversion layer to maintain
3. **Debuggability**: What you see is what gets sent
4. **Documentation**: Comments explain why, not what transformation happens

### Key Learning
When frontend and backend use different terminology:
- Consider using backend terminology in API layers for clarity
- Document the terminology difference, not the conversion
- Avoid "magic" conversions that hide what's actually happening
- Make the code's intent obvious to future developers

### When to Apply This Pattern
- API integration layers
- Database query builders  
- External service integrations
- Any boundary where terminology differs
