# System Improvement Actions

This document tracks concrete actions derived from learning entries to improve the system.

## Active Improvements

### 1. Automated Branch Protection Checks
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Description**: Create automated validation for PR base branches

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Add to .github/pre-commit or as git hook
#!/bin/bash
# Check if PR targets staging first
if [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == "main" || "$BASE_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: PRs should target 'staging' branch first!"
  echo "Use: gh pr create --base staging"
  read -p "Continue anyway? (y/N) " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### 2. Task Implementation Workflow
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md)
**Status**: ✅ Documented
**Description**: Formalize the successful workflow pattern

**Standard Workflow**:
1. Create/claim Linear task
2. Update status to "In Progress"
3. Create feature branch
4. Implement changes
5. Run pre-PR checklist
6. Create PR to staging
7. Update Linear to "In Review"
8. Document learnings

### 3. Root Cause Verification Protocol
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md) (PR #21 investigation)
**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Description**: Ensure fixes address actual problems

**Protocol**:
1. Reproduce the issue locally
2. Verify issue exists in reported environment
3. Identify root cause with evidence
4. Test fix in same environment as report
5. Include reproduction steps in PR

### 4. Bug Report Verification Template
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-252](./2025-07-11-KEY-252.md)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Description**: Improve bug reports to avoid miscommunication

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Bug Report Checklist
- [ ] Feature/Component exists in the UI
- [ ] I can navigate to the feature
- [ ] The issue is not that the feature is missing
- [ ] Exact error or behavior described
- [ ] Steps to reproduce included
- [ ] Environment specified (local/preview/staging)
```

**Why**: KEY-252 was reported as "empty tab" but the tab didn't exist at all.

### 5. UI Feature Audit
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-252](./2025-07-11-KEY-252.md)
**Status**: 📋 Planned
**Description**: Audit property detail page for other missing tabs

**Action Items**:
- [ ] List all data hooks that exist
- [ ] Check which ones have UI implementations
- [ ] Create tasks for missing UI components
- [ ] Ensure data layer and UI layer are in sync
