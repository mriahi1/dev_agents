# System Improvement Actions

This document tracks concrete actions derived from learning entries to improve the system.

## Active Improvements

### 1. Automated Branch Protection Checks
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md)
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Description**: Create automated validation for PR base branches

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Add to .github/pre-commit or as git hook
#!/bin/bash
# Check if PR targets staging first
if [[ "$BASE_BRANCH" == "main" || "$BASE_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: PRs should target 'staging' branch first!"
  echo "Use: gh pr create --base staging"
  read -p "Continue anyway? (y/N) " -n 1 -r
  echo
  if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

### 2. Task Implementation Workflow
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Documented
**Description**: Formalize the successful workflow pattern

**Standard Workflow**:
1. Create/claim Linear task
2. Update status to "In Progress"
3. Create feature branch
4. Implement changes
5. Run pre-PR checklist
6. Create PR to staging
7. Update Linear to "In Review"
8. Document learnings

### 3. Root Cause Verification Protocol
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-251](./2025-07-11-KEY-251.md) (PR #21 investigation)
**Status**: üìã Planned
**Description**: Ensure fixes address actual problems

**Protocol**:
1. Reproduce the issue locally
2. Verify issue exists in reported environment
3. Identify root cause with evidence
4. Test fix in same environment as report
5. Include reproduction steps in PR

### 4. Bug Report Verification Template
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-252](./2025-07-11-KEY-252.md)
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress
**Description**: Improve bug reports to avoid miscommunication

**Template Addition**:
```markdown
## Bug Report Checklist
- [ ] Feature/Component exists in the UI
- [ ] I can navigate to the feature
- [ ] The issue is not that the feature is missing
- [ ] Exact error or behavior described
- [ ] Steps to reproduce included
- [ ] Environment specified (local/preview/staging)
```

**Why**: KEY-252 was reported as "empty tab" but the tab didn't exist at all.

### 5. UI Feature Audit
**Source**: [2025-07-11-KEY-252](./2025-07-11-KEY-252.md)
**Status**: üìã Planned
**Description**: Audit property detail page for other missing tabs

**Action Items**:
- [ ] List all data hooks that exist
- [ ] Check which ones have UI implementations
- [ ] Create tasks for missing UI components
- [ ] Ensure data layer and UI layer are in sync

## Completed Improvements

### Learning Protocol System
**Completed**: 2025-07-11
**Impact**: Systematic capture of insights for continuous improvement
- Created learning entry template
- Established meta-learning process
- Set up improvement tracking

## Metrics to Track

1. **Branch Strategy Compliance**
   - PRs to staging vs main ratio
   - Time to catch branching errors

2. **Fix Effectiveness**
   - Issues reopened after "fix"
   - Root cause identification accuracy

3. **Process Efficiency**
   - Time from task start to PR
   - Linear status update compliance

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Review new learning entries
- **Monthly**: Update improvement actions
- **Quarterly**: Analyze metrics and adjust processes
