# Learning Entry: KEY-234 - Property Drawer API Endpoint Fix

**Date**: 2025-07-11
**Task**: KEY-234 - Property drawer does not load data
**Outcome**: ✅ Success - Fixed and PR created

## What Happened
Successfully diagnosed and fixed the property drawer data loading issue. The root cause was an incorrect API endpoint in the PropertiesService. 

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
- Property drawer opened but showed empty state instead of property data
- API calls were going to `/api/v1/operations/{id}` (404 errors)
- Should have been going to `/api/v1/properties/{id}`

### Location of Issue
**File**: `lib/api/properties-service.ts`
**Line**: 79 (constructor)
```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect):
constructor() {
  super('operations');  // Wrong endpoint!
}

// AFTER (correct):
constructor() {
  // Fix: Use 'properties' endpoint instead of 'operations'
  // The backend API expects property requests to go to /api/v1/properties/{id}
  super('properties');
}
```

### Why It Happened
- The backend API terminology uses "operation" for **filtering** (e.g., `?operation=123` in query params)
- But the **endpoint** itself should still be "properties" 
- This was a misapplication of the operation parameter concept from KEY-252

## What Went Well
- ✅ **Systematic Investigation**: Followed the investigation plan created earlier
- ✅ **Correct Diagnosis**: Found the exact root cause quickly
- ✅ **Targeted Fix**: Single line change with clear documentation
- ✅ **Proper Workflow**: Created branch, committed, PR to staging [[memory:2965613]]
- ✅ **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive PR description and commit message

## What Went Wrong
- ❌ **Initial Confusion**: Spent time in wrong directory at first
- ❌ **Command Escaping**: Had issues with complex Linear update command

## The Fix

### Technical Solution
```typescript
// Changed PropertiesService constructor endpoint from 'operations' to 'properties'
constructor() {
  super('properties');  // Correct API endpoint
}
```

### Implementation Process
1. **Created feature branch**: `fix/KEY-234-property-drawer-api-endpoint`
2. **Made targeted fix**: Single line change with documentation
3. **Committed with clear message**: Explained root cause and solution
4. **Created PR to staging**: https://github.com/keysylabs/keysy_front3/pull/27
5. **Updated Linear task**: Changed status to "Done"

## Key Learnings

### 1. API Endpoint vs Parameter Naming
- **Context**: Backend APIs may use different terminology for endpoints vs parameters
- **Learning**: "operation" is used for filtering parameters, but endpoint is still "properties"
- **Application**: Always verify both endpoint path AND parameter naming separately

### 2. Systematic Debugging Process
- **Context**: Complex issues with multiple potential causes
- **Learning**: Following the investigation plan (component → hook → API) led to quick diagnosis
- **Application**: Create and follow structured investigation plans for efficiency

### 3. Single Responsibility Changes
- **Context**: When fixing bugs with clear root cause
- **Learning**: Make minimal, targeted changes with clear documentation
- **Application**: Avoid scope creep; fix one thing at a time

### 4. Proper Git Workflow
- **Context**: Working in existing project repositories
- **Learning**: Always target staging branch, create descriptive PRs
- **Application**: Follow established team workflows and branch protection rules

## Testing Results Expected

### Before Fix
- Property drawer shows empty state
- Network tab: 404 errors on `/api/v1/operations/{id}`
- Console errors about failed API calls

### After Fix
- Property drawer loads property data correctly
- Network tab: Successful calls to `/api/v1/properties/{id}`
- All tabs in drawer work: Overview, Treemap, Units, Expenses

## Related Issues
- **KEY-252**: Similar API parameter issue (operation vs property_id)
- **Pattern**: Backend API terminology mapping [[memory:2979217]]
- **Workflow**: Branch protection and staging workflow [[memory:2965613]]

## Action Items Completed
- [x] Identify root cause (API endpoint mismatch)
- [x] Implement targeted fix
- [x] Create PR to staging branch
- [x] Update Linear task to Done
- [x] Document learnings for future reference

## Success Metrics
