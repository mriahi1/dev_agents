# Component Integration Issue: Missing Tab Content

## Date: 2025-07-11
## Task: KEY-252 (Leases Tab Empty)

### What Happened
User reported that the leases tab was empty. Investigation revealed that the PropertyLeasesTab component was fully implemented but not integrated into the property detail page.

### Root Cause
The component existed but there was no conditional rendering for `activeTab === 'leases'` in the property detail page. The tab button was visible but clicking it didn't render any content.

### Investigation Process
1. Checked if PropertyLeasesTab was being imported âœ“ (it was)
2. Looked for where tab content is rendered based on activeTab
3. Found other tabs had `{activeTab === 'tenants' && (...)}` patterns
4. Discovered no such pattern existed for leases tab
5. Found that the integration was actually already done but the API call issue persists

### Key Learning
When implementing tabbed interfaces:
1. **Always verify end-to-end integration** - Component existence doesn't mean it's being used
2. **Follow existing patterns** - Check how other tabs are rendered
3. **Test the full user flow** - Click the tab and verify content appears
4. **Separate concerns** - The API call issue might be from a different component

### API Investigation
The user reported an API call without the `operation` parameter:
- URL: `https://api.keysy.co/api/v1/leases?status=active&page=1&page_size=10`
- Missing: `operation` parameter for property filtering

This suggests either:
1. A different component is making this call
2. There's a global data fetcher
3. The PropertyLeasesTab isn't being mounted properly

### Action Items
- [x] Verify PropertyLeasesTab is rendered when activeTab === 'leases'
- [ ] Add logging to confirm PropertyLeasesTab is mounting
- [ ] Check for other components making lease API calls
- [ ] Verify the operation parameter is being passed correctly
