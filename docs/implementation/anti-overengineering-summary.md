# 🛡️ Anti-Overengineering Summary

## Safeguards in Place

### 1. Mandatory Guardrails Document
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_GUARDRAILS.md](../../IMPLEMENTATION_GUARDRAILS.md)** - Must be read before EVERY coding session
- Clear forbidden actions and allowed scope
- Automatic enforcement via Makefile

### 2. Automated Validation
- **`scripts/validate_guardrails.py`** - Runs automatically
- Checks file sizes (max 300 lines)
- Checks file count (max 10 in src/)
- Detects forbidden patterns
- Validates function length (max 50 lines)

### 3. Makefile Integration
```bash
make verify      # Runs guardrail checks
make test        # Runs guardrail checks first
make run-dry     # Runs guardrail checks first
make run         # Runs guardrail checks first
```

### 4. Hard Limits Enforced
- ❌ NO LangGraph (removed from MVP)
- ❌ NO databases (except minimal state)
- ❌ NO web UI
- ❌ NO complex abstractions
- ❌ NO multi-file editing
- ✅ ONLY simple text changes
- ✅ ONLY staging branch
- ✅ ONLY 6 core files

### 5. Triple-Checked Plan
- Original cognitive loops → Deferred to later
- Complex monitoring → Removed
- Database persistence → Removed
- Web dashboard → Removed
- **Result**: 10 hours of coding max

### 6. Circuit Breakers
If you see yourself:
- Adding a 4th integration → STOP
- Creating base classes → STOP
- Adding queues → STOP
- Building UI → STOP
- Adding caching → STOP

### 7. Success = Simple
The ONLY success criteria:
1. Reads Linear task ✅
2. Makes simple change ✅
3. Creates PR to staging ✅
4. Updates Linear status ✅

**NOT** success criteria:
- Performance
- Scalability
- Extensibility
- Feature completeness

## How This Prevents Drift

1. **Every command checks guardrails first**
   - Can't run tests without passing
   - Can't deploy without passing

2. **Clear "FORBIDDEN" list**
   - No ambiguity about what's allowed
   - Specific patterns blocked

3. **Automated enforcement**
   - Not just documentation
   - Active validation

4. **Simple metrics**
   - File count: 10 max
   - File size: 300 lines max
   - Function size: 50 lines max

5. **Constant reminders**
   - README warning
   - Makefile messages
   - Validation output

## The Implementation Path

```
Day 1: Setup (2-3 hours)
├── Install dependencies
├── Configure .env
└── Run make verify

Day 2: Build MVP (4-5 hours)
├── Linear client (150 lines)
├── GitHub client (150 lines)
├── Simple creator (100 lines)
└── Main loop (150 lines)

Day 3: Test & Ship (2-3 hours)
├── Basic tests
├── Dry run testing
└── First production run
```

## If Tempted to Add Features

Read these files IN ORDER:
1. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUARDRAILS.md** - The law
2. **triple-check-validation.md** - Why MVP is enough
3. **mvp-implementation.md** - What to build

Then run:
```bash
make guardrails
```

If it fails, you're overengineering.

## Remember

> "The enemy of DONE is PERFECT."

> "Ship the MVP, then iterate."

> "Every line of code is a liability."

The goal is a WORKING system in 3 days, not a perfect system in 3 months.
