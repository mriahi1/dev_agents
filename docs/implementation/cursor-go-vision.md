# 🚀 The "Cursor Go" Vision (Milestone 2)

## The Dream

```
You: "go"
Cursor: "Starting autonomous implementation..."

[4 hours later]

Cursor: "Completed 5 tasks, created 5 PRs, all tests passing"
```

## How We Get There

### Step 1: MVP (Now) ✓
Prove we can:
- Read Linear tasks
- Make simple changes
- Create working PRs
- Not break anything

**Technology**: Basic Python + APIs

### Step 2: Intelligence Layer
Add the brains:
- GPT-4 for understanding tasks
- LangGraph for orchestration
- Pattern library for common changes
- Test generation

**Technology**: + LangGraph, OpenAI, LangChain

### Step 3: Cursor Integration
Make it seamless:
- Continue.dev API integration
- Real-time progress in Cursor
- Inline approval UI
- Live code preview

## The Autonomous Day

### Morning Ritual (5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Review Linear board
cursor> show linear tasks
[Shows 8 tasks marked "auto-pr-safe"]

# 2. Review safety settings
cursor> check safety
✓ Dry run: disabled
✓ Max complexity: 5
✓ Target branch: staging
✓ Approval required: complexity > 3

# 3. Start the engine
cursor> go
```

### Human Oversight

While it runs, you can:
- Monitor progress in Cursor's sidebar
- Get Slack notifications for approvals
- Review PR previews in real-time
- Pause/resume anytime
- Override decisions

## Key Technologies for "Cursor Go"

### 1. LangGraph (Orchestration)
```python
class CursorGoGraph(StateGraph):
    """The brain of autonomous implementation"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Cognitive nodes
        self.add_node("select_task", self.select_next_task)
        self.add_node("understand", self.understand_with_ai)
        self.add_node("plan", self.plan_implementation)
        self.add_node("implement", self.write_code)
        self.add_node("test", self.generate_tests)
        self.add_node("verify", self.run_checks)
        self.add_node("submit", self.create_pr)
        
        # Smart routing
        self.add_conditional_edges(
            "plan",
            self.check_complexity,
            {
                "simple": "implement",
                "complex": "human_review",
                "too_complex": "defer_task"
            }
        )
```

### 2. GPT-4 (Understanding)
```python
async def understand_task(self, task: LinearTask) -> Understanding:
    """Use GPT-4 to deeply understand the task"""
    
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze this development task:
    Title: {task.title}
    Description: {task.description}
    
    Determine:
    1. What files need to change
    2. What the changes should be
    3. What tests to add
    4. Complexity (1-10)
    5. Risks
    """
    
    return await gpt4.analyze(prompt)
```

### 3. Continue.dev (Cursor Integration)
```python
class CursorInterface:
    """Real-time updates in Cursor"""
    
    async def show_progress(self, status: str):
        await continue_api.sidebar.update({
            "current_task": status.task,
            "progress": status.percent,
            "next_action": status.next
        })
    
    async def preview_changes(self, diff: str):
        await continue_api.diff.show(diff)
```

## Safety Nets

Even in autonomous mode:

1. **Complexity Limits**
   - Auto-approve only simple changes
   - Human review for complex tasks
   - Skip if too risky

2. **Pattern Matching**
   - Known safe patterns go fast
   - Unknown patterns need review
   - Dangerous patterns blocked

3. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Start with 1 task/day
   - Increase as confidence grows
   - Always have kill switch

## The Path Forward

### From MVP to "Go"

1. **Week 1-2**: Ship MVP, prove basics work
2. **Week 3-4**: Add GPT-4 understanding
3. **Week 5-6**: Integrate LangGraph orchestration
4. **Week 7-8**: Add Cursor integration
5. **Week 9+**: Polish and scale

### Success Metrics

The system is ready when:
- 50+ PRs created successfully
- <5% need human fixes
- Saves 4+ hours/day
- Developers trust it

## Remember

**MVP First**: Can't run before we walk
**Progressive Enhancement**: Each layer adds value
**Human Partnership**: Augment, don't replace
**Safety Always**: Better safe than sorry

---

The vision is clear: **"go" in the morning, PRs by lunch.**

But first, we ship the MVP.
