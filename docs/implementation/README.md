**Latest Learning**: Always target `staging` branch for PRs, never `main` directly. See [2025-07-11-KEY-251](learnings/2025-07-11-KEY-251.md).

## Architecture

The toolkit follows a simple architecture:
- **CLI Interface** - Click-based commands for all operations
- **Integration Clients** - Separate clients for Linear, GitHub, etc.
- **JSON Output** - Structured output for Cursor to parse
- **Environment Config** - Simple .env file configuration

## Design Principles

1. **Simple Over Complex** - Each tool does one thing well
2. **Transparent Operations** - No hidden behavior
3. **Cursor-Friendly Output** - JSON when needed, human-readable otherwise
4. **Extensible** - Easy to add new integrations

## Current Integrations

- **Linear** - Task management (list, create, update)
- **GitHub** - Repository operations (branch, PR creation)

## Adding New Integrations

To add a new integration:
1. Create a client in `src/integrations/`
2. Add commands to `src/main.py`
3. Update environment variables in `env.example`
4. Document in the README

Keep it simple - the toolkit provides operations, Cursor provides intelligence.
